      <description>Code Geass is well-known in the anime world for being one of the greats. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the opportunity myself to watch it before, for various reasons&amp;mdash;it aired in 2006, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually go out of my way to watch mecha, the character design isn&amp;rsquo;t really up my alley&amp;mdash;but after doing so, I can definitely see why this series is so highly regarded.
Art: 2&amp;frasl;4 There&amp;rsquo;s nothing too special about the art in Code Geass.</description>

      <description>Things I liked:
 The killing off of Euphemia was done well, even if the events leading up to it were sort of contrived (it seems weird that Lelouch would bring up &amp;ldquo;killing all Japanese&amp;rdquo; out of nowhere). It really raises the stakes now. CC&amp;rsquo;s mecha pilot outfit looks nice.  Cornelia&amp;rsquo;s betrayal: Classic plot twist done nicely.  Things I didn&amp;rsquo;t like:
 I never noticed this before, but Kallen&amp;rsquo;s mecha pilot outfit looks outrageous:  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the Britannian military&amp;rsquo;s plan is with using Lancelot.</description>
